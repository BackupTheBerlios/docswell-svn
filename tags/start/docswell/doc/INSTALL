Fast installation guide

You need to have a webserver (we have tested the system with Apache),
PHP3 or PHP4, PHPLib and MySQL installed in your system.

* user$ mysql -h host -u database_superuser -p
  (insert superuser_password)
* mysql> USE mysql;
* mysql> INSERT INTO user VALUES ( 'host', 'operator', PASSWORD('operator_password'), 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'Y', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N');
* mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
* mysql> CREATE DATABASE docswell;
* mysql> exit;
* user$ tar -zxvf docswell-x.x.tar.gz
* user$ mysql -h host -u operator -p < docswell/sql/dw.sql
  (insert the operator_password)
* user$ vi docswell/include/local.inc
  (insert the correct database parameters; please, keep docswell as the database name)

   var $Host     = "host";
   var $Database = "docswell";
   var $User     = "operator";
   var $Password = "password";

Ok, that's it. You've finished installing and configuring
DocsWell. Start your browser and visit
http://yourserver/docswell/index.php3. As you'll see, DocsWell
comes with some inserted example documents. You can
delete or modify them by entering as an administrator. To do so, login
as the default administrator with user,editor,admin permissions.
At the prompt use the following ID to login (case sensitive):

    Username: oldfish
    Password: oldfish

Vert important: Be sure of immediately changing the login and password by
clicking on the User Admin link. You'll notice this is quite easy to do ;-)
